To set up the environment you must have npm installed as well as the expo cli. 

Open a terminal within vscode and type "npm install"

Once the installation is complete, go back into the vscode terminal and enter "expo start" 

Your default web browser will open and display a QR code, scan it with the expo app on your phone, or set up an ios or android emulator.
